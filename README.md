# Wolpope
Wolpope is a modern wallpaper manager for Windows. Automatically change your desktop and lock screen backgrounds using tags from Wallhaven.
### Dashboard & Controls
Easily monitor your current desktop and lock screen wallpapers. Pause the slideshow, skip to the next image, or quickly add a wallpaper to your favorites right from the home screen.

### Settings & Tag Filtering
Fine-tune the app behavior: set exact times or intervals for wallpaper changes, enable "Game Mode" to pause during fullscreen apps, and pick your favorite Wallhaven categories to tailor your feed.
